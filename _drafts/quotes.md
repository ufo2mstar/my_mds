# Donald Knuth

> Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do. 

> Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it. 

> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do. 

> Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%. 

> AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires 'thinking' but has failed to do most of what people and animals do 'without thinking'-that, somehow, is much harder.

> If you optimize everything, you will always be unhappy.


# Bob Proctor
> No amount of reading or memorizing will make you successful in life. It is the understanding and application of wise thought that counts.
 
# Alan Turing

> Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.

> If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent.

> Programming is a skill best acquired by practice and example rather than from books.

> Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no-one can imagine
  

# Brian Kernighan
> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.

> Life is too short to run proprietary software.


# Perl Bashing

> What's wrong with perl?

It combines all the worst aspects of C and Lisp: a billion different
sublanguages in one monolithic executable.  It combines the power of
C with the readability of PostScript.

> To me perl is the triumph of utalitarianism.

So are cockroaches.  So is `sendmail'.


# Dijkstra
> The computing scientist’s main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.

 6. “The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late.”
- Seymour Cray

5. “To iterate is human, to recurse divine.”
- L. Peter Deutsch

4. "On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament]: 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."
- Charles Babbage

3. "Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program."
- Linus Torvalds

2. "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."
- Martin Golding

1. “There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.”
- C.A.R. Hoare
