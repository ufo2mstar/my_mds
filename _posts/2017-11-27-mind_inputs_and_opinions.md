# Jokes and Things accepted as true
Deceit of expectation.
Originally thought of making this "Hipocrisy and other traits to contend with"
Evolved into analysis of different mindsets.

# PreScript:
Insights serve well cataloged online, so that not only you, but the whole world can know how terrible your thoughts were..

There is one virtue that I feel should be among the most valued today: It is the importance of being able to change your mind!..

## That Twitter quote
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">open-minded people are curious why people do not agree with them. close-minded people are frustrated that people do not agree with them.</p>&mdash; Auren Hoffman (@auren) <a href="https://twitter.com/auren/status/934549509941497856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

Starting with giving people the benefit of doubt that they are manking the best decision possible with all the information that they have,
it is not too hard to see that people can be absolutely wrong! it only serves humanity better if we can accept these errors and try to make better decisions int he future as a direct consequence.

## How-to
Opinions are objects you carry with you in a box and should be easily replaceable, swaping it out for a better opinion if they turn out to be no good anymore..The trick is to keep your identity separate from your opinions..


If you attribute your opinions to your identity, i.e: what's in the box is who your are, then you will cling to them despite any evidence to the contrary!

If your want to always be right, be prepared to change your mind!!

PS: I'm even open-minded about this opinion of mine and welcome any feedback or anything point of views.

# A Defence of staying-put!
Are there any merits to narrow/close mindedness?
My problem with close-minded people is that their moutn is always open :P
Jokes aside, although I feel that healthy skepticism is always a benefit, the sustenance of this trait through the evolutionary timeline can quite simply be attributed to a good survival strategy.. as a survival strategy you can either fall or flourish as a flock! 
Close-minded adherence to leadership at times of crisis at it's best leads to revolutions (French or American, touting the way to these thriving economies of today), and  at it's worst leads to world wars (on both sides, both sides.. from the Nuremberg defense to Hiroshima)
But under the premise that you have the time to luxuriate on any topic, and intellectual prowess to play deep into reality, I would say, opt for the former.. open minds opens doors!

# Neutral-minded, non-opinionated, nonviolent stoicism..
I used to think meditating, to death, on the meaning of life! 
I failed to see the irony in this. Being an influencible youngster with access to books and different local cultures, the story of Buddha 
 
Terrible.. Good for sitting idle and being detached all good for doing nothing, if nothing is what you want to do.. Good for mother nature, not for progress and our one true war: species survival against nature!
A rock is Good.. it follows all the laws of nature perfectly, exists solely to one day dissolve into sand.. the difference: we have a certain capacity of volition. Maybe not free Will exactly, but good enough to go against known nature with good reasoning.. co-existence of works with a certain degree of control! Going against nature is what is natural, if survival is a goal; least we give in and succumb to nature which only tries to end us at every turn possible (check out ways to get better at cheating death as well)

Nature is an active player in this infinite game. In fact that is the only player that considering.. nature and natural laws (God : if you will) by sheer size, it is impossible to control it, but defence against it's active hostility demands a conceited, cooperated effort, which of nothing else is the a good argument to keep the hatred and misunderstandinga among us homosapiens (and other species willing to cooperate, like canine canine, horse etc.. we are not necessarily cooperating with creatures we use as food! That is exactly where we understand nature and choose to dominate, for its neo-cortical calorie and other nutritional benefits)
Chances of survival only increases with increase in understanding of the rules of the game: the laws governing all things around and within us.

Echoing the same virtues of a domestic pet.. Man should be man's best friends: not because of some utopian idealistic hakunamata peaceful existence but to get the best score in this non-zero sum game. This is by far the best argument for unity I see. The only problem is groups and tribes not sharing this sentiment may be terribly mistaken trying to dominate for short term gains, not seeing the game for what it truly is..

one can very well get through life pretending to above isn't our reality, but the more i see the world and try to understand the rules better, the more inevitability the above understanding seems: the only way to make progress, move forward in the game of life
