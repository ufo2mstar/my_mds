# Pre Script
Tools we use to understand and manipulate the world were built piece by peice by individual humans

> an endlessly self-renewing bonfire of outrage and confusion

It's hard to get reliable news online as the news cycle moved so quickly that it's difficult to follow complicated stories over time 
Besides, the architecture of the social Internet bubbles up the loudest and most divisive voices over more cautious and nuanced ones..


 the point is whatever Golden Age of Internet discourse people harken back to is inevitably misremembered
 
 we need to look at the differences between our goals as a species and the goals of the private companies that hosts so much of our public discourse 
 
# speed = x / time


# virtual distances 
Where is the internet?
More a design philosophy than an actual entity

Most metirocratic open competition.

Predatory Monopolistic policies
