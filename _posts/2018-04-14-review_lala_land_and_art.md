# Pre Script


Prescriptive thoughts
As I have come to realize that there is more to life than Morality, 
I am trying to document my current understanding and interests in this space.

Jordan Peterson highlights the Problem of life in a very _interesting way_
Life is Suffering tainted with Malevolence..

Landscape of being
Tragic element of suffering is the fate of the bug squished out of indifference.
Unuse of full potential, all opportunities, 
laziness, procrastination, irritation

feel-good self-esteem optimism and downright pessimism

Problem of life embedded in the structure of life!
Contend with the 
inadequecies of the self while also dealing with the
Unhelpful Arbitrariness (mostly tyranny) of the social world and
Cold Brutality of the natural world
Plot your course through the maze

Status and consciousness.. hierarchy and exploitation.. consequences of political and economic schemes. getting the balance right is the problem. 
Now that we have the root-cause the next step is
marxist: the price of in-equality and hierarchy laid at the feet of capitalism and the free-market

voluntary acceptance of the arrows and slings of the unfair and outrageous fate

Purpose of Memory
purely melovelant actions
causal analysis
reconfigure
