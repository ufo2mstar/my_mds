# Please learn Git! ASAP..
_**Quick tip for developers**_:  if you are not using **git** (even if you are using some other [Version Control System](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/)) for your development, please pause your life and learn it! :flushed:
In all seriousness, I feel that it is one of the most under-rated tools that neither schools cover as a requisite in courses nor do developers spend a lot of time mastering.

I am relatively new to the world of Git as well (coming from [SVN] and thinking that it was all that!)  


### quick side-note
Here is some bashing or [SVN]
1. [SVN, Git Out of Here](https://mentormate.com/blog/differences-git-svn/)
2. [and other proselytization](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/why-you-should-switch-from-subversion-to-git)   

but to be fair, here are [some things myth busting](https://svnvsgit.com/), but personally the killer fact that it is a
a [Distributed local VCS](https://betterexplained.com/articles/intro-to-distributed-version-control-illustrated/) does it for me, 
(now that I understand the workflow better).


## Sources to start from
There are a million awesome resources out there made with love and care by people who have been in this business much 
longer than I have, so I would like to refer to some of their good work that I have benefited from to get you started,
 
1. [Git Book] - The default primer
2. [Atlassion Guide to Git] - my personal favorite!
3. [Branching] - once you got the basics
4. [Gitflow] - and once you are comfortable with Branching, you should take a look at this approach to collaborate 

## Interactive tutorials
There are a lot of cool interactive tutorials that I would personally recommend as well if you are not in a position 
to try it out on a computer right now:

1. [Github's] - good place to start
2. [CodeAcademy's] - another excellent resource
3. [Branching] - once you are done with the basics, this is a key feature you should get

## Video resources
And for those who learn better by watching
