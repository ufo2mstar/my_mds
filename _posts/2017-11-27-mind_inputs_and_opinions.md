# PreScript:
Insights serve well when cataloged online, as not only you, but the whole world can better understand your positions.. said every blogger ever :v: :grin:

## an approach..
Let us start by giving them the benefit of doubt: 
> People make the best decision possible with all the information that they have access to.

As you know so well from solving all those Math problems in school, how easy it is to be **_absolutely wrong!_**  
And the sad part is, you may not even know it unless your error is pointed out and the right answer is explained.  

Thus, if correct answers are what you are after, it only serves you better if you can accept these errors, learn the best approach and make better decisions in the future...

## a point of view..
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">open-minded people are curious why people do not agree with them. close-minded people are frustrated that people do not agree with them.</p>&mdash; Auren Hoffman (@auren) <a href="https://twitter.com/auren/status/934549509941497856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

## an opinion..
At a glance, this intelligent quote makes you nod in agreement :smile: 
seeming to indicate that everybody tends to disagree with others, doggedly stand their ground, and wonder why the '_other side_' does not agree with us more.

Give it a few seconds, and you may notice the mischaracterization of the two sides here.

When it comes to subjective opinions, people may not agree with eachother because:
1. they don't **understand** the reasoning of the other side well enough.  
or
2. the opinion does not resonate with their **values**.  
or
3. they are too `stubborn` to try and learn anything new! :stuck_out_tongue:

> Disclaimer:  
As always, I am not a big fan of bucketing of people into such broad categories. Depending on the situation, these are just different states of mind that everybody is subject to and capable of displaying.   
Calling out people as **close-minded**, just because they are _more prone to standing their ground_, or **open-minded** , just because _they claim that they are_ just isn't fair :expressionless:


# Expert Systems
There is an extremely important but acutely undervalued virtue today: 
> the importance of being able to **change your mind!**..

Let's quickly go through the advent of our attempt to crack AI: developing systems that display aspects of intelligent behavior. One of the earliest successful solutions to the [knowledge acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_acquisition) problem was modeling decision-making of highly skilled experts in certain fields (say doctors) by means of a set of **if-then-else** rules. Although these [Expert Systems](http://www.umsl.edu/~joshik/msis480/chapt11.htm) proved to be reasonably reliable [in many fields (even financial risk management, etc)](https://hbr.org/1988/03/putting-expert-systems-to-work), some of the issues observed were:
 1. It was difficult to simplify many questions to simple limited sets of rules
 2. Even if done in intricate detail, exceptions can throw off the predefined rules
 3. Performance drops exponentially ($2^n\,rules$ even for simple systems) as domain knowledge grows
 4. Adaptability to change can be very tedious depending on which level the change lies  
 
Apart from more experiment-design issues such as: 
 5. Getting the time and resources of the real Experts to contribute knowledge in the face of actually doing their tasks
 6. Encoding more complex rules in subject domains with many pathways becomes difficult without data model changes
 7. Available technology can be a problem, but [Moores law usually kicks in to save the day](http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-03-12/after-moores-law)
 
 Long story short, knowledge transference problems needed a more versatile and probabilistic model that adapts its internal state (more **fuzzy** than **binary**) to _figure out_ the answer. Hence the necessity of something more than a simple rule-based approach gave rise to a more amenable evolution of this system: in the form of [`Neural Networks`](http://ncase.me/neurons/).
 
Transposing the insight from the above exercise into a workable life lesson, we have: 

## How-to
Opinions are like objects you carry with you in a box and should be easily replaceable: _swaping it out for a better opinion if they turn out to be no good anymore.._
>The trick is to keep your identity separate from your opinions.

If you attribute your opinions to your identity, _i.e: what's in the box is who you are_, then you will cling to them despite any evidence to the contrary!

## Because
> If you want to be right all the time, you have got to be ready to change your mind!!

From the three possible degrees of improper information, being:
- Uninformed, 
- Under-informed and 
- Utterly Misinformed

the only way to be properly informed is to put new information through an `evaluation filter`. No matter how clean or cluttered your information pathway is, you can better it with effort. Honing this data-processing-knowledge-acquisition procedure, in practice, can help you process prejudiced propaganda and purge it for purity!  
Watch the unfolding of this natural process in our brains [beautifully simplified and visualized (by Nicky Case) in this link](http://ncase.me/neurons/)  
Simple probability shows us how we are more likely to be wrong about things we have little knowledge or experience in: by the sheer fact that there are many more ways to be wrong than right!
The significance of this self-correction feedback loop should not be understated, because, isn't this exactly what we call **learning!** :blush: 


# In defense of inflexibility! 
Could there be any merits to narrow/close-mindedness?  
Though we regard people displaying this trait as a nuisance, this quote (that I remember seeing somewhere) underlines the primary pain point about these weird and wonderful folks:
> The problem with close-minded people is that **their mouth is always open!** 
:sob: :weary: :loudspeaker: :rage3:

Once you take the time to learn more about where they stand, and you imagine them more complexly, you begin to see why their perspective may not be as absurd as you initially thought.
- Sometimes it is just that they **struggle to communicate** their internal thoughts and emotions clearly
- Sometimes they just don't care, as they **falsely assume** everybody else is as **closed-off to listening to reason** as they are :confused:
- Sometimes it may be that they **don't have the courage of their convictions** and are honestly afraid that their crutch, i.e: _their belief system_, may crumble if they truly test out the tenets of their system...

## quick side-note (or a side-swipe!)
The extent to which I wonder if people really believe in what they say is illustrative in that some of my dear friends, who I love and respect, are proud to brand themselves as [Conservatives](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/conservative), and I find it amusing how the thesaurus generously adorns this characteristic with such epithets as :smiley: :
- illiberal
- inflexible
- unimaginative
- unprogressive
- traditionalistic
- reactionary
- unchanging
- controlled
- timid
- firm

(contrasted with [Liberal](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/liberal) which seems to radiate more pleasing attributes! :innocent:)

## Jokes aside, 
Although I feel that **healthy skepticism is always a benefit**, the sustenance and prevalence of the trait of **narrow-minded support of an in-group** through evolutionary history can only be ascribed to being 
> **a good survival strategy**, as it is _more favorable to flourish or fall as a **flock**!_ 

## Circumstances
Some major prerequisite to broad-minded explorations are: 
- appropriate mental faculty
- latent ability
- the luxury of Time!

Though in [game-theory terms]({{ site.base_url }}/blog/2017/11/10/friendship_limit_0_to_dunbar), every species is locked in an infinite game against the universe and everything else in it, the subjective experience of every specimen in it is **time-bound**. 

Hence **delayed decisions** are _naturally undesirable_ as it `comes at a cost` and packaged with:
1. [logarithmically diminishing returns](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/the-law-of-logarithmic-returns/)
2. the ticking time-bomb of the price we pay, in terms [of opportunity cost!](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2547).. (For more info, do check out the papers in the _References_ section)

>'The cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.'  
> -- Oscar Wilde

**Critical impartial pursuit** of all problems is not practical, and hence we must be capable of deciding 
- which problems we have the option of investigating before committing to and 
- which ones we outsource our choice  

Just that it needs to be a `conscious decision`, and not just a **forced-hand** (hopefully) or **laziness**. :neutral_face:

## Watch out for
Sometimes when your _vision is limited_ and _direction is uncertain_, there is merit in following **authority (or the _elite_)**...  
Chief among the many cautions to be mindful of with this approach are:
1. the ambiguity in establishing the credibility of the leader to handle the situation
2. the possibility of selecting charlatans and rhetoricians and salesmen! (if the political climate of late is anything to go by)
3. the effects of committing regrettably disgraceful deeds as a result 

## And In practice
> "I was **only following orders!**"

Historically Close-minded adherence to leadership at times of crises:
 
- at it's best leads to **Revolutions** and **Independence movements**  
like the **French** and **American Revolutions** etc., laying the groundwork for these thriving economic centers of today
- at it's worst leads to **World Wars**  
from the **Nuremberg defense** to **Manhattan Project**.. _**both sides, both sides**_ :smirk: (oh! 2017 presidential references, how long will you be remembered?) 

It is very hard to prescribe a generic course of action, for the multivariate problems we solve every day and the decisions we are faced with. But IMHO, I feel a certain degree of self-consciousness (of your mental station) along with factoring in facts (both historical and evident scientific facts) goes a long way in keeping bias at bay. 

# On neutral, non-opinionated, nonviolent stoicism
Okay... this post has inflated enough already! :sweat_smile: and we have covered both the edge cases (close- and open-mindedness)  
Check out the analysis of the dispassionate neutral-mind on the next installment of `reasoning by making connections from non-intuitive disparate subject fields!`

# Bottomline
But for any topic (casual or contentious), if I have time to revel on it, and intellectual prowess to pry into its depths, I myself opt for the former, as I believe in this cheesy one-liner:
> An open mind surely opens doors!

and for those who feel I am being too idealistic, **remember** (to vaguely (_mis_)quote something I have heard before) 
> No pessimist has ever won a war...


# PS: 
If you feel any of the above could use a kind word (or two) of advice, I would like to encourage you to let me know in the comments below please :relaxed: 

Cheers!
