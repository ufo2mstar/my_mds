I think that one potential problem that's that's worth discussing but it would take forever to discuss it is the relative role of the individual versus the state.
You can see this argued out in the prophetic books and in the Old Testament: the Jewish state and it's sort of the central player in some sense but there's clear evidence that it can become corrupt it can fall away and that a prophet who's an individual has to step forward and we revivify it right
And so there's tremendous emphasis on the utility of the individual you see that in judea judaism 
i would say overall it's a very cohesive idea and it promotes in-group cohesion 
let's say but it also allows for individual expression in a very interesting ways because there's tremendous emphasis in jewish culture on learning and an articulation and mastery of ideas and so that provides this space for the individual to flourish with christianity you see more of a move away i would say from the idea of the state 
now that's not necessarily without its troubles one of the things Jung pointed out was well as Christianity becomes more about the individual the religion itself tends to fragment like it did with Protestantism until just fragments right to the point where every individual is their own church! 
and then you have no continuity and tradition and the Catholics were kind of a bulwark against that but I do think that there's a discussion to be had about the relative role of the individual in redeeming the world let's say versus the state in redeeming the world 
I would say the Christians come down more strongly on the side of the individual and the Jews come down more strongly on the side of the state 
I'm willing to be corrected about that but yeah I've never actually been able to have a discussion with anyone so I think there's some truth to that 
I think the idea of you know in in Hebrew ami Sorrell liked the idea of the nation of Israel being paramount when you pray you pray in collective terms you don't pray in individual terms 
everything is done in terms of anachronisms we praying as a group right supposed to pray in a minyan so how do you swear that away in your own ways? how do you square that away? 
yes there's a lot there's a lot of play in the joints meaning that so for example to take the most to take the most obvious example with you if you wanna talk about the power of the Jewish state I in sort of biblical context there's tremendous argument between whether a kingship is a good thing or a kingship is a bad 
Larry in the Old Testament right and it says it says like Samuel warns the Jewish people if you take a king here's what's gonna happen it's all gonna suck right and then they form a kingship and things suck 
mhm and so there's a strong case to be made that kingship was not actually what was wanted because you have an entire period of just judges 
and the judges are legitimately just individuals who are trusted by the people but then they can be supplanted at any time by another judge who's not from a lineage 
so you know that so when we say that that group identity matters in Judaism it matters to the extent that you're following God's law but if you stray away from that the idea I think Judaism has always said that what you do is what makes you part of the group not what you are
so Judaism has a weird dichotomy in it that's largely driven by exigent circumstances which is the idea of biological Judaism versus the idea of religious Judaism 
so I care very little about biological Judaism like when somebody says you know somebody is such and such as Jewish 
no I'm Chomsky's Jewish like so what I I really don't care and and I think that most Orthodox Jews we basically biological Judaism or your mom was Jewish which is the way that it works in Orthodox Judaism is the sort of the entry ticket to being Jewish 
meaning you have to either have converted in or your mom has to be Jewish in order for you to
