<blockquote>
  <p>‘Politics is too important to be left to the politicians’<br />

<p>I used to think meditating, to death, on the meaning of life! 
I failed to see the irony in this. Being an influencible youngster with access to books and different local cultures, the story of Buddha</p>

<p>Terrible.. Good for sitting idle and being detached all good for doing nothing, if nothing is what you want to do.. Good for mother nature, not for progress and our one true war: species survival against nature!
A rock is Good.. it follows all the laws of nature perfectly, exists solely to one day dissolve into sand.. the difference: we have a certain capacity of volition. Maybe not free Will exactly, but good enough to go against known nature with good reasoning.. co-existence of works with a certain degree of control! Going against nature is what is natural, if survival is a goal; least we give in and succumb to nature which only tries to end us at every turn possible (check out ways to get better at cheating death as well)</p>

<p>Nature is an active player in this infinite game. In fact that is the only player that considering.. nature and natural laws (God : if you will) by sheer size, it is impossible to control it, but defence against it’s active hostility demands a conceited, cooperated effort, which of nothing else is the a good argument to keep the hatred and misunderstandinga among us homosapiens (and other species willing to cooperate, like canine canine, horse etc.. we are not necessarily cooperating with creatures we use as food! That is exactly where we understand nature and choose to dominate, for its neo-cortical calorie and other nutritional benefits)
Chances of survival only increases with increase in understanding of the rules of the game: the laws governing all things around and within us.</p>

<p>Echoing the same virtues of a domestic pet.. Man should be man’s best friends: not because of some utopian idealistic hakunamata peaceful existence but to get the best score in this non-zero sum game. This is by far the best argument for unity I see. The only problem is groups and tribes not sharing this sentiment may be terribly mistaken trying to dominate for short term gains, not seeing the game for what it truly is..</p>

<p>one can very well get through life pretending to above isn’t our reality, but the more i see the world and try to understand the rules better, the more inevitability the above understanding seems: the only way to make progress, move forward in the game of life</p>
