#Friendship-limit: 0 to Dunbar Number

##Kinship and friendship
As my quest to pin down morality continues, one important concept that I want to put down is my current take on the facts around friendship and kinship.
One of the strong contentions I hear from my friend (an ardent supporter of all-things-Indic) is echoing the sentiments of his recent guru Ashay Naik 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hinduism is kinship based not ideology based. Easy to enter in ideological group not so in a kinship network. <a href="https://t.co/xpjJAgb6N9">https://t.co/xpjJAgb6N9</a></p>&mdash; Damanaka (@AshayNaik1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AshayNaik1/status/926966427797434368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

To me, ideological bonds, formed out of necessity, rather than mere presence remain more meaningful and stand the test time. Though I do agree that 
kinship bonds have a simpler identity marker for the limbic system to recognize, other than for the closest of relations, I am not sure how much this holds sway.

ironically depicts the possible attitudes of a self-centered culture of kins, who in a zero sum game, can play the field: as, in that case, greed is rewarded.

## the selfish-gene (reciprocal altruism)
Thinking about how the moral landscape is not subject to feelings of kin-favoritism (as I believe the term nepotism doesn't exactly work in this context) led me thinking about the selfish gene. Granted that kins are closer in the gene-network than others, there is a fundamental difference between the two: one is natural and the other is not. 
One of the many understated points here is that people should not necessarily take their cues from nature, as that would not be a congenial society to co-exist and thrive, for, after all, we have spent millennia making civilization possible by understanding that life on this beautiful planet is a non-zero sum game, and in game-theory terms, we sure are in an essentially infinite game with nature.

## karmic chameleon
The point to emphasize here is that the whole point of choosing ideology is to go against nature (as we do with so many other things and actions that we readily associate with comfort and development today; albeit we haven't been as self-aware of the consequences of some of our attempts at betterment).

It is a perfectly good strategy for days when exploration of allies far across known borders was limited, and collective-action was better than self/kin-loathing. The difference is parameter here, with globalization, to parochial equates to being non-sustainable. As can be noted that there are no winners if you want to beat members of your own team!

Friends (relationships, whether or not with benefits) are the support structures around each lattice of the tetrahedron. Inter-dependence is woven into this tapestry wherein following the golden-rule (do unto other's thing: colloquially translates to "Don't be a Jerk!") maximizes the benefits of the local-group, irrespective of whether it is fact-based or family-centric. And to the point of this post, there is a natural stabilization point in this quantified by the Dunbar number: which spells the upper bound for the type of relationship vs depth of connection equation.

# The friendship-limit equation

As the emotional currency (and the time dimension) for individuals are limited, there is an unspoken agreement among the participants in any pair-bond situation that is determined, not necessarily by origin and agreement of opinions, but similar to the inverse square law of attraction (be it gravitation or electromagnetism)... 
1. proximity (mental accessibility) - similar to the distance factor
2. propensity (emotional availability) - similar to the mass or charge of the two-body system


$$\lim_{x\to 0}

$$\lim_{x\to (N)}

# Bottomline
I feel this voluntary support bartering that shines through, over any fatalistic pre-determinacy that may light our path in the true battle to come: surviving the inevitability of Darwinian nature taking it's course as the geological and archeological history suggests.
