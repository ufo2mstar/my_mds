# For non-programmers
There are tons of cool places you can start learning ruby from,  
but here are some that I personally took and felt were good!

1. [A very good interactive tutorial - by codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)

2. [A funky but good tutorial](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)

3. A friend said that [he learned it here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/)

4. Here is a quick and dirty tutorial, [but covers all the bases](http://www.troubleshooters.com/codecorn/ruby/basictutorial.htm)

# If you have confortable with programming
Take a look at [my primer and try it out on your machine]({{ site.base_url }}/blog/2015/01/09/primer_ruby/))
And here is [another blog post of mine, to get started with testing]({{ site.base_url }}/blog/2016/05/23/tut_testing_topics/)  


Ruby's [own website has some good tips](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) on where to get started.
I recommend reading books as well, 
1. [this is a pretty cool book that I started it all with](https://books.google.com/books/about/Beginning_Ruby.html?id=MiGpDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false)
2. this was a good place to [dig through and learn a lot of fancy stuff](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596523695.do)
3. for more advanced tips, try [the computationbook](http://computationbook.com/)
4. [Eloquent-Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104)

## Note:
you can also find the pdfs of some of these books online!
If you are really keen on learning ruby well, try and get one of these books from the libraries around here, 
and if possible, even go ahead and Buy them!!
