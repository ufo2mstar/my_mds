# PreScript:
Insights serve well cataloged online, as not only you, but the whole world can better understand your position.. said every blogger ever :bowtie:

## an approach..
Let us start by giving them the benefit of doubt: 
> People make the best decision possible with all the information that they have access to.

If solving Math problems in school is any indication, it is not too hard to see that as people, on many things we can easily be ***Absolutely wrong!***  
It only serves us better if we can accept these errors and try to make better decisions in the future as a direct consequence.

## a point of view..
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">open-minded people are curious why people do not agree with them. close-minded people are frustrated that people do not agree with them.</p>&mdash; Auren Hoffman (@auren) <a href="https://twitter.com/auren/status/934549509941497856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

## an opinion..
At a glance, this intelligent quote makes you nod in agreement :smile: 
Seeming to indicate that everybody tends to disagree with others, doggedly stand their ground and wonder why the 'other side' does not agree with them more.

But reading into it, you notice the mischaracterization of the two sides.

When it comes to subjective opinions, people may not agree because:
1. they don't **understand** the reasoning well enough.  
or
2. the opinion does not resonate with their **values**.  
or
3. they are too `stubborn` to try and learn anything new! :stuck_out_tongue:

> Disclaimer:  
As always, I am not a big fan of broad biased bucketing of people into such broad categories. These are different states of mind that everybody is subject to and capable of displaying, depending on the situation.   
Calling out people as close-minded just because they are more prone to standing their ground or open-minded because they claim they are just isn't fair :expressionless:


# Expert Systems
There is an extremely important but acutely undervalued virtue today.. 
> the importance of being able to **change your mind!**..

Let's quickly go through the advent of our attempt to crack AI by developing systems that display aspects of intelligent behaviour for a moment. One of the earliest successful solutions to the [knowledge acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_acquisition) problem was by modeling decision-making of highly skilled experts in certain fields (say doctors) by means of a set of **if-then** rules. Although these [Expert Systems](http://www.umsl.edu/~joshik/msis480/chapt11.htm) proved to be very reliable, [in many fields (even financial risk management, etc)](https://hbr.org/1988/03/putting-expert-systems-to-work), some of the issues observed were
 1. It was difficult to simplify many questions to simple paired rules
 2. Even if done in intricate detail, exceptions throw off predefined rules
 3. Performance drops exponentially ($2^n\,rules$ even for simple systems) as domain knowledge grows
 
 Apart from more experiment design issues such as 
 4. Getting the time and resources of the real Experts to contribute knowledge in the face of actually doing their tasks
 5. Encoding more complex rules in subject domains with many pathways becomes difficult without data model changes
 6. Available technology can be a problem, but [Moores law usually kicks in to save the day](http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-03-12/after-moores-law)
 
 Long story short, these kinds of problems needed a more versatile and probabilistic model that adapts its internal state (more **fuzzy** than **binary**) to _figure_ out the answer, hence giving rise to a more amenable evolution of this system in the form of `Neural Networks` than a simple rule-based approach.  
 
Transposing the insight from the above exercise into a workable life lesson, we have 

## How-to
Opinions are like objects you carry with you in a box and should be easily replaceable: _swaping it out for a better opinion if they turn out to be no good anymore.._
>The trick is to keep your identity separate from your opinions.


If you attribute your opinions to your identity, _i.e: what's in the box is who you are_, then you will cling to them despite any evidence to the contrary!

## Because
> If you want to always be right, you have got to be ready to change your mind!!

On the three possible degrees of improper information, being:
- Uninformed, 
- Under-informed and 
- Utterly Misinformed

the only way to be properly informed is to put new information through the evaluation filter (no matter how clean or cluttered it is) and honing this information (particulars) processing procedure in practice so that prejudiced propaganda can be purged for purity. ([the unfolding of which beautifully simplified and visualized here in this link](http://ncase.me/neurons/)) 
Simple probability shows us how we are more likely to be wrong than right about things we have little knowledge or experience in: by the sheer fact that there are many more ways to be wrong than not!
The significance of this feedback loop for self-correction should not be understated, because isn't this exactly what we call **learning!** :blush: 


# In defense of inflexibility! 
Could there be any merits to narrow/close-mindedness?  
A quote I remember seeing somewhere that underlines the main problem with :
> The problem with close-minded people is that **their mouth is always open!** 
:sob: :weary: :loudspeaker: :rage3: 

## quick side-note (more like a side-swipe :wink:)
The extent to which I wonder if people really believe in what they say is illustrative in that some of my dear friends, who I love and respect, are proud to brand themselves as [Conservatives](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/conservative), and I find it amusing how the thesaurus generously adorns this characteristic with such pleasing epithets as :smiley: :
- illiberal
- inflexible
- unimaginative
- unprogressive
- traditionalistic
- reactionary
- unchanging
- controlled
- timid
- firm

{% comment %}
(contrasted with [Liberal](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/liberal) which seems to radiate more pleasing attributes! :innocent:)

## Jokes aside, 
Although I feel that **healthy skepticism is always a benefit**, the sustenance and prevalence of the trait of **narrow-minded support of an in-group** through the evolutionary history can only be ascribed to being 
> **a good survival strategy**, as it is _more favorable to fall or flourish as a **flock**!_ 

## Circumstances
Some major prerequisite to broad-minded explorations are: 
- appropriate mental faculty
- latent ability
- the luxury of Time!

Though in [game-theory terms]({{ site.base_url }}/blog/2017/11/10/friendship_limit_0_to_dunbar), every species is locked in an infinite game against the universe and everything else in it, the subjective experience of every specimen in it is **time-bound**. 

Hence **delayed decisions** are _naturally undesirable_ as it `comes at a cost` and packaged with:
1. [logarithmically diminishing returns](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/the-law-of-logarithmic-returns/)
2. the ticking time-bomb of the price we pay, in terms [of opportunity cost!](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2547).. (For more info, do check out the papers in the _References_ section)

>'The cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.'  
> -- Oscar Wilde

All this goes to say is that **critical impartial pursuit** of all problems is not practical, and hence we must be capable of deciding which problems we have the option of investigating before committing to and which ones we outsource our choice; Just that it needs to be a `conscious decision`, and not just a **forced-hand** (hopefully) or **laziness**. :neutral_face:

## Watch out for
Sometimes when your _vision is limited_ and _direction is uncertain_, there is merit in following **authority (or the _elite_)**...  
Chief among the many cautions to be honored with this approach are:
1. the ambiguity in establishing the credibility of the leader
2. the possibility of selecting charlatans and rhetoricians and salesmen (if the political climate of late is anything to go by)

## And In practice
Historically Close-minded adherence to leadership at times of crisis
> "I was **only following orders!**"
 
- at it's best leads to **Revolutions**  
like the **French** or **American Revolutions**, laying the groundwork for these thriving economic centers of today
- at it's worst leads to **World Wars**  
from the **Nuremberg defense** to **Manhattan Project**.. _**both sides, both sides**_ :smirk: (oh! 2017 presidential references, how long will you be remembered?) 

It is very hard to prescribe a generic course of action, in simple terms, for the multivariate complex problems we solve every day and the decisions we are faced with. But IMHO, I feel a certain degree of self-consciousness (of your mental station) along with factoring into your formulation historical and evident scientific facts, goes a long way in trying to keep bias at bay. 

# On Neutral-minded, non-opinionated, nonviolent stoicism..
K, this post has inflated enough already! :sweat_smile:  
if interested check out the next installment of `reasoning from disparate subject fields`

# Bottomline
But for any topic (casual or contentious), if I have time to revel on it, and intellectual prowess to pry into its depths, I myself opt for the former, as I believe in this cheesy one-liner
> an open mind surely opens doors!

and for those who feel I am being too idealistic, **remember** (to vaguely (_mis_)quote something I have heard before) 
> No pessimist has ever won a war...

If you feel any of the above can use a kind word or two, I would like to encourage you to let me know in the comments below please :relaxed: 

Cheers!
