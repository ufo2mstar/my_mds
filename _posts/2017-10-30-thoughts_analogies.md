> Disclaimer:
I was fortunate enough to have been introduced to the age-old collection of Indian fables that I still hold dear: 
Stories from the [PaÃ±catantra](http://www.talesofpanchatantra.com/short-stories-for-kids) and 
[Jataka Tales](http://www.buddhanet.net/bt1_conts.htm)... 
The exciting and wonderful anthropomorphic world that these stories led me into was my first foray into the moral 
dimension and possibly the start in the making of me.

A dear friend of mine has been fixated on a book he came across 
[Natural Enmity: Reflections on the Niti and Rasa of the Pancatantra](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Enmity-Reflections-Pancatantra-Commentary/dp/1537751832) 

as I was penning down my thoughts and read some panchathantra for my research, i realized where we are talking across each other.. what you are calling moral (in terms of natural enmity, which in retrospect is apparent from your lion-deer example) is what i call survival strategy.. the objective morals i am talking about is the set of rules that if all the lions follow

I recently got lobbed juicy full toss with a terribly misplaced metaphor (thus demonstrating how tenuous reasoning by analogy can be). 

a priori (ie: making conclusions through theoretical inferences rather than empirical evidence)

It's almost a game to point out where the analogy breaks down, but with due consideration to this fact, certain comparisons are at best wrongheaded and at worst, deliberately malicious and using intending to use rhetoric to win the argument

To dissect your example:
a. In the abstract:
I'd like to point out that you may agree that morality for Lions doesn't change with Lions of a different Forest. 

b. and in the real world:
If you are going to draw comparisons with the food chain, understand that morality is a concept that is supposed to fight the natural order of animalistic actions.. forming a society and giving comfort not just to the immediate progeny is the whole point of project civilization.. in this non-zero sum game

the absolute morality that I am saying science can help with is founded on objective claims that are the same for all species.


Haha, drafting a reply made me write enough for a blog post. 
request: can I have a non-fable-istic point (eg: what's your top reason(s) why different ethnics should not share moral values? - the key distinction, am not saying different traditions, just the moral foundation (as they seem to share all other valuable things that science had to offer like medicine, technology, economics, trade and proper understanding of physics)), just so that I can defend your position? ðŸ˜Š

If we base our beliefs on incorrect foundational ideas, it is not surprising that we end up making bad decisions... With a fundamental premise that reality is unique and is not subject to sense perceptions like. The [Nyaya school of Indian philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaya) which observational inferences

There are things that are different in character in the above example.
While it is always endearing to our inner-child to see anthropomorphic characters engaged in a battle of wits, the unfortunate
tantalizing
tenuous

Philosophy is like Rainman: a slow elder brother, who rocks, lives in the dark and can't help you out directly, but without whom you wouldn't be here today.

## Feynman's approach to tackling philosophy
1. Hear the view point
2. take the exact opposite of it and see how the world would be different if it were true than what it is now
3. if not, then it just as well be either

Tit for tat may lose battles, but wins wars..
