> Pre-script:
I was fortunate enough to have been introduced to the age-old collection of Indian fables that I still hold dear: 
Stories from the [Pa√±catantra](http://www.talesofpanchatantra.com/short-stories-for-kids) and 
[Jataka Tales](http://www.buddhanet.net/bt1_conts.htm)... 
The exciting and wonderful anthropomorphic world portrayed was my first foray into the moral dimensions and quite possibly the makings of me.

A dear friend of mine has been fixated on a book he came across 
[Natural Enmity: Reflections on the Niti and Rasa of the Pancatantra](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Enmity-Reflections-Pancatantra-Commentary/dp/1537751832) 

I recently got lobbed a juicy [full toss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_toss) with a terribly misplaced metaphor, demonstrating how reasoning-by-analogy can be tenuous.
Making _a priori_ assumptions about human nature (ie: arriving at conclusions from theoretical inferences rather than empirical evidence) from sagacious political guides from a bygone era may not be very prescriptive today: as the parameters with which we are playing the game of life has changed dramatically!


As I was penning down my thoughts after reading some stories from Panchathantra for my research, I realized where we are talking past each other:

 
# To my dear friend,   
What you are calling _moral_ (in terms of **Natural Enmity**, which in retrospect is apparent from your Lion-Deer example) is what I call a survival strategy.. However, the _objective morals_ I am talking about is the set of rules that that all the Lions inevitably follow, that results in a stable solution the [Lotka-Volterra] model for [Predetor-Prey dynamics]. The inevitability is the 'Natural' aspect of these sort of mathematical models that is working on the premise that the agents in the model have no perceivable meta-awareness of their situation and act without [free-will](https://www.iep.utm.edu/freewill/) (which is a Whole Other Conversation!.. as David Hume rightly called it 'the most contentious question of metaphysics!')

My point is that it is not necessary to **submit to all-things-natural** just because it is **only natural** :smirk:  
A conscious entity, who is willful enough to cause change and strong enough to act on it can subvert the stability of any mathematical model.

# The Answer is Choice!

It's almost a game to point out where the analogy breaks down, but with due consideration to this fact, certain comparisons are at best wrongheaded and at worst, deliberately malicious: intending to use rhetoric to win the argument!

To dissect your example:
## a. in the abstract:
Though the `dharma` of the Lion is different from that of the Deer, you can see that the morality for Lion doesn't change with Lion of a different Forest.
> Predators be predators 

## b. and in the real world:
If you are going to draw comparisons with the food chain, understand that morality is a concept that is supposed to fight the natural order of animalistic actions.. 

> The world today is no more a zero-sum game:  
now, it is not necessary for someone to lose for another to win!

Forming a society to sustainably encourage spreading of comfort, and not just to the immediate progeny, is the whole point of our `civilization project`.

a slow elder brother, who lives in the dark, can't help you out directly,  
but without whom you wouldn't be here today.

## so what to do?
[The Moral Landscape](https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/) ([Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/books/)) has convinced me that **Absolute morality**, founded on objective claims, is the same **for a species as a collective!**  
I am not saying that different traditions need the have the same value system, but the moral foundation would need to align. Afterall, they seem to share all other valuable additions that advances in Science and Technology has to offer like in medicine, automation, trade, etc: all arising from a [proper understanding of Physics!](#why-physics-needs-philosophy) :smile:


## Need for co-operation

> Tit for tat may lose battles, but wins wars!!

If we base our beliefs on incorrect foundational ideas, it is not surprising that we end up making bad decisions...  
With a fundamental premise that reality is unique and is not subject quirks in our sense perceptions (like the [Nyaya school of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaya) which observational inferences professes) .

There are things that are different in character in the above example.
While it is always endearing to our inner-child to see anthropomorphic characters engaged in a battle of wits, the unfortunate

## Feynman's approach to tackling philosophy
1. Hear out the point-of-view
2. Take the exact opposite of it and see how the world would be different if it were true..
3. if nothing is going to be different, then it might as well be either

Haha, drafting a reply made me write enough for a blog post. 
request: If anyone has a non-fable-istic point on any of the below, eg: 
1. what's your top reason(s) why different ethnics should not share moral values? 
2. what would be the key reasons for differences?
