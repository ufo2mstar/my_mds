# PreScript:
Insights serve well cataloged online, as not only you, but the whole world can better understand your position..

## an approach..
Let's starting by giving them the benefit of doubt: 
> People are making the best decision possible with all the information that they have access to.

If solving Math problems in school is any indication, it is not too hard to see that as people, we can be ***Absolutely wrong!***  
It only serves us better if we can accept these errors and try to make better decisions in the future as a direct consequence.
## a point of view..
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">open-minded people are curious why people do not agree with them. close-minded people are frustrated that people do not agree with them.</p>&mdash; Auren Hoffman (@auren) <a href="https://twitter.com/auren/status/934549509941497856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

## an opinion..
At a glance, this intelligent quote makes you nod in agreement :smile: 
Seeming to indicate that everybody tends to disagree with others, doggedly stand their ground and wonder why the 'other-side' does not agree with them more.

But reading into it, you notice the mis-characterization of the two sides.

When it comes to subjective opinions, people may not agree because:
1. they don't **understand** the reasoning well enough.  
or
2. the opinion does not resonate with their **values**.  
or
3. they are too `stubborn` to try and learn anything new! :stuck_out_tongue:

> Disclaimer:  
As always, I am not a big fan of broad biased bucketing of people into such categories. I feel that these are different states of mind that everybody is subject to, and calling out people as close-minded just because they are more prone to standing their ground or open-minded because they claim they are just isn't fair :expressionless:


# Expert Systems
there is an extremely important but acutely undervalued virtue today.. 
> the importance of being able to **change your mind!**..

One of the earliest successful solutions to the [knowledge acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_acquisition) problem was by modeling decision-making of highly skilled experts in certain fields (say doctors) by means of a set of **if-then** rules. Although this proved to be very reliable, in many fields (even financial risk management, etc), some of the issues observed were
 1. It was difficult to simplify many questions to simple paired rules
 2. Even if done in intricate detail, exceptions throw off predefined rules
 3. Performance drops exponentially ($2^n\,rules$ even for simple systems) as domain knowledge grows
 
 Apart from more experiment design issues such as 
 4. Getting the time and resources of the real Experts to contribute knowledge in the face of actually doing their tasks
 5. Encoding more complex rules in subject domains with many pathways becomes difficult without data model changes
 
 Long story short, these kinds of problems needed a more versatile and probabilistic model that adapts its internal state (more **fuzzy** than **binary**) to _figure_ out the answer, hence giving rise to a more amenable solution in the form of `neural networks` than a `rule-based approach`  
 
Transposing the insight from the above exercise into a workable life lesson, we have 

## How-to
Opinions are objects you carry with you in a box and should be easily replaceable, swaping it out for a better opinion if they turn out to be no good anymore..The trick is to keep your identity separate from your opinions..


If you attribute your opinions to your identity, i.e: what's in the box is who your are, then you will cling to them despite any evidence to the contrary!

## Because
> If you want to always be right, you have got to be ready to change your mind!!

On the three possible degrees of improper information, being:
- Uninformed, 
- Under-informed and 
- Utterly Misinformed

the only way to be properly informed is to put new information through the evaluation filter (no matter how clean or cluttered it is) and honing this information (particulars) processing procedure in practice so that prejudiced propaganda can be pried of for purity.  
Simple probability shows us how we are more likely to be wrong than right about things we have little to no knowledge in: by the sheer fact that there are many more ways to be wrong than not!
The significance of this feedback loop for self-correction should not be understated, because that is exactly what we call **learning!**  


# In defence of staying-put! uncompromisingness inflexibility 
Could there be any merits to narrow/close mindedness?  
A funny quote I remember seeing somewhere:
> The problem with narrow-minded people is that **their mouths is always open!** :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:  

## quick side-note
The extent to which I have trouble understanding people is simply illustrative in that some of my dear friends who I love and respect are proud to tag themselves as a [Conservative](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/conservative), and I find it interesting how the thesauras generously adorn the word with such epithets as :smiley: :
- illiberal
- inflexible
- unimaginative
- unprograssive
- unchanging
- controlled
- reactionary
- traditionalistic
- timid
- firm

(contrasted with [Liberal](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/liberal) which seems to radiate more pleasing attributes!)


## Jokes aside, 
Although I feel that **healthy skepticism is always a benefit**, the sustenance and prevalence of this trait through the evolutionary timeline can only be ascribed to be 
> **a good survival strategy**, as it is _more favorable to fall or flourish as a **flock**!_ 

## In action
> "I was **only following orders!**"

Close-minded adherence to leadership at times of crisis 
- at it's best leads to **Revolutions**  
like the **French** or **American Revolutions**, laying the groundwork for these thriving economic centers of today
- at it's worst leads to **World Wars**  
from the **Nuremberg defense** to **Manhattan Project**.. _both sides, both sides_ :smirk: (oh 2017 presidential references, how long will you be remembered?) 

## Circumstances
Some major prerequisite to open-minded exploration are: 
- appropriate mental faculty
- latent ability
- the luxury of Time!

Though, in [game-theory terms]({{ site.base_url }}/blog/2017/11/10/friendship_limit_0_to_dunbar)), every species is locked in an infinite game against the universe and everything else in it, the subjective feeling of every specimen in it is **limited (time-bound)**. Hence **decisions** naturally come with 
1. [logarithmically diminishing returns](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/the-law-of-logarithmic-returns/)
2. the ticking time-bomb of the price we pay, in terms [of opportunity cost!](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.2016.2547).. (For more info, do check out the papers in the References section)

## Watch out for
Sometimes when _vision is limited_ and _direction is ambivalent_, there is merit in following **authority (or the _elite_)**...
Among the many concerns with this approach is
1. the uncertainity in establishing the credibility of the leader
2. the possibility of selecting charlatans and rhetoricians and salesmen (if the political climate of late is anything to go by)

# On Neutral-minded, non-opinionated, nonviolent stoicism..
Alright, this post has inflated enough already!.. watch out for the next installment of, reasoning from disparate subject fields :grin:

# Bottomline
But with time to revel on any topic (casual or contentious), and intellectual prowess to pry into its depths, I myself opt for the former, as I believe 
> open minds opens doors!

and for those who feel I am being too idealistic, **remember** (to vaguely misquote something I have heard before) 
> No pessimist has ever won a war..


# PS: 
If you feel any of the above can use a kind word or two, I would like to encourage you to let me know in the comments below please :simple_smile:  

Cheers!
