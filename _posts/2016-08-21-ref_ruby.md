# For non-programmers
There are tons of cool places you can start learning ruby from,  
but here are some that I personally felt were good:

1. [A very good interactive tutorial - by codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)

2. [tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0): A funky but good tutorial.

3. A good friend said that [she liked learning Ruby at `tutorialspoint`](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/)

4. Here is a [quick and dirty tutorial](http://www.troubleshooters.com/codecorn/ruby/basictutorial.htm) by [Steve Litt](http://www.troubleshooters.com/email_steve_litt.htm), but covers all the bases

# If you are comfortable with programming
1. Ruby's [own website has some good tips](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) on where to get started.
2. Take a look at [my primer and try it out on your machine]({{ site.base_url }}/blog/2015/01/09/primer_ruby/))
3. And here is [another blog post of mine, to get started with testing]({{ site.base_url }}/blog/2016/05/23/tut_testing_topics/)  

# For Pros
If you are getting cozy with Ruby, I recommend the following resources:

1. [Beginning Ruby](https://books.google.com/books/about/Beginning_Ruby.html?id=MiGpDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false) is a pretty cool book that I started it all with, if you have a good programming background..
2. The [Ruby Cookbook](https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/Ruby/Ruby%20Cookbook_%20Recipes%20for%20Object-Oriented%20Scripting%20%282nd%20ed.%29%20%5BCarlson%20%26%20Richardson%202015-03-25%5D.pdf) offers quite a good list of recipes if you are looking for ad-hoc code that can come in handy for your project..
3. This brilliantly done ruby-guide [RobyMonk](http://rubymonk.com/learning/books) covers all levels: from apprentice all the way to Ruby-Ninja!
4. For more hardcore CS applications on Compiler and [Finite-state Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) design, try [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com/about)'s fascinating book: [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com/)
5. I felt [Eloquent-Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321584104) gave me some good insights, tips and best-practices.. 

## Note
With a few minutes looking them up online, you can find most of the `pdfs` of these books!
But if you are really keen on learning Ruby well, try and start with one of these books from your local library! 
Or if possible, **please go ahead and buy** them: 
> Why not support the author and also `invest in yourself`?
